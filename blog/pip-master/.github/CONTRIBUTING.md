# Contributing to pip

## Bot Commands

We have a bot monitoring the [pypa/pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) repository
to help manage the state of issues and pull requests to keep everything running
smoothly. Each command given to the bot should be on its own line and is
generally case sensitive. Multiple commands may be listed in a single comment
(but they must each be on their own line) and the comments may also include
other, non command content.

Command | Who can run it | Description
--- | --- | ---
`/request-review` | anyone | Dismisses all of the current reviews on a pull request, making it appear back in the review queue.
